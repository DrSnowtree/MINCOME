I added a dummy in the baseline taking the value of 1 if the number of children has increased in a household

The dummy is 0 if the increase has taken place in the first 9 months (this should still be adjusted by the date the family enrolled) 

I then subset my sample to households in Winnipeg only and then merge it with the mincome711 data, which includes information on Winnipeg families 

I do the merge and look at the differences between the two datasets 

There are 74 increases if we look at the increase in the number of children, and 43 if we compute the number by looking at births and family relations
7 are not observed in the first, 38 are common and 36 are not observed in the second dataset

Reasons for differences are: 
- family birthday information is missing in family structure data: 13 cases
- joining person is another relative: once only!
- once, grandchild -> also important if the head has adult children, who then have children themselves and stay in the household
- the family structure data was not collected monthly but also 3/4 times, so if the child was born after the last survey, it is likely that they were not registered
increases not registered as birth: in m36, 35, 32, 30, 21, 33, 39 
-when the family size is very large, sometimes the info seems inconsistent, likely that a child moves out and then in 
-six families that are counted in family data are not included in the first data because they dropped out within the first six months

it seems that we might be missing quite a few births because a) birthday and relationship data is missing and b) the child is born after the last family structure survey took place 
the danger with using the increase in children: a) we can count relatives like brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces but this only occurs 1 time in 74 in Winnipeg 
b)in the very big families, it can be misleading, this is about 3-4 cases
if we can assume that these happen randomly, then we can also use the increase in numbers 
family size is not random though, it is a factor that determines assignment 
still can be used 


#family 1459, likely that there was a mistake at the interview
#or one of the adult children moved back in after a couple of months 
#the month where the nr of children increases is 26 

#in 1568, it seems that there was indeed a new child, the number of children 
#increases and stays the same until the end of sample, but the birthday 
#information is somehow missing in the Winnipeg sample, that's why not counted
#the month where the nr of children increases is 17

#1703, last three months both the nr of children and fam size increases
#in Winnipeg sample with fam info, there is only info for four people in total
#the fifth person does not seem to exist 
#the month where the nr of children increases is 35

#family 2233 has one more child starting on month 36

#family 3902 in month 32 

#family 4097 in month 30 

#family 4347 in month 23, but this is maybe indeed not a  birth 
#family size changes a lot 
#family composition data shows: there is info on 9 members in total 
#two heads, five daughters and two sons 
#in month 23 where a new child might have arrived, there were 7 people, 
#two heads, three adults (children over 16) and two children, and then it was 
#three children 
#possible that in month 27, one child turns 16 and then towards the end, one moves out 


#5274, entered in month 21, family size info and all rest seems consistent afterwards 
#3 daughters and one son seen in Winnipeg sample 

#5393 two adults one male and one female head, a child enters in month 11
#who is missing from Winnipeg sample 

#5708, month 13, from 3 to 4 children, information seems consistent 
#there is one female head and thee daughters that can be seen in the fam structue
#data, but the family was not included in the first four months so that is why 
#it was eliminated
#and idea could be to use the baseline data, and use the information of the month they started 
#and eliminate observations accordingly 

#fam 7343 had one child entering in month 21, and then another one in month 23
#which already suggests that it is not a pregnancy, in family data we see that 
#everyone is either male or female head or son/daughter and there is info for 
#five people so that the other two are not at all registered there 

#fam 7963, in family data we see one female head, a daughter and a son
#and they all seem to be living since the same time no return, no reason 
#month 16 

#family of 7 with one female head and otherwise all children in fam data 
#in basepay data at some point fam size decreases then increases again so
#two children were probably out and then returned, this should be 
#eliminated 

#fam 9965 seems to have had a child in month 10 but they only started in month 4
#so this can be eliminated too 

#5 people in fam data, a female head, four kids, it seems like the kid comes back because
#it is 4 and then 3 and then 4 again 

#10737 there are seven people in total at the beginning and then they mabe move and then 
#move back in, does not seem very reliable in any case, but also one male head and then 
#all daughters and sons 

#10923, month 11 although started in month 2

#11047 month 33, four people in fam data, two kids and two parents so probably fifth 
#person is a baby came after the last survey 

#11073, actually no info on family structure 

#12551, very big fam, information on 12 people in fam data 
#all kids and parents except for one grand-daughter, which 
#is evidence for fertility, just not of the head 

#12774 month 23, no birth and relation info in fam data 

#13306 likewise no info in fam data 

#13382 also no info in fam data 

#14324 month 21, this time indeed no child, brother 

#14848 no info in fam data, month 29  

#15951, no info in fam data 

#16063, no info in family data 

#in month 17, there is one child and no longer after 30, check this again 

#16687 no info 


#same prob as before, child 10 but participate in m 2 

#17983 no info, two children in months 11 and 35  

#18555, no info, but the numbers seem consistent 

#18576 no info 

#18614 no information 

#now the ones in fam data but not in the panel data 

#2534  the one increase is in month 4 

#5395 seems to have dropped out within the first two years so they are not in basepay data 

#likewise for 9051 
#11028 not in basepay but don't know why 

#15029 stopped answering 

#15691 stopped answering after month 19 

#17883 stopped answering after month 20
